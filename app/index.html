  This group is for everyone who's interested in the current and future state of Virtual Reality, in and around Manchester. VR is now a multi-billion dollar industry, with some of the best minds on earth working on it. Let's meet up and discuss the current state of tech, where it's going, and what we can do with it. Bring demos and tech if you have them! Whether it's Oculus Rift, Razer Hydra, Leap Motion, Kinect, Myo, STEM, Morpheus, or any other tech old new, let's get like-minded people together. We'll start off with social drinks, and see where it takes us.
